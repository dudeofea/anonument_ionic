The second attempt at bringing chatrooms into meatspace.

I tried doing this app in Android (Java) when that's all I knew about app dev, but now it just makes sense to redo it in ionic and to use a map view instead of writing my own compass, which I could always do later (read: never again)

Progress
--------
About 70%, just need to add a comments section and it should be viable.

Installation
-----------
Requires ionic. that's about it
